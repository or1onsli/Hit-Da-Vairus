A simple iOS game made with CoreAnimation.

## What's this project about
This demo app was born after a programming task (called *nano challenge*) during my studies at the **ï£¿ Developer Academy** in Naples. The aim of the challenge was to create a *Wach-a-Mole* like game called "*Hit The Designer*" where you have to hit as many times as you can in 60s the head of our design teacher Francesco.


In the second phase of the challenge we were asked to change the rules blending the game into something different and that's how the idea of **Hit-da-Vairus** came out. I talked with my friend and collegue **Fabio Cipriani** and *we had this idea of an iMac which is threathened by the viruses and you have to hit them in time* (IE: before they reach the Mac). The game is divided in waves of viruses which are more in number and faster batch after batch.
